# JacksToOpen
using java to make one of my favorite card games, jacks to open trips to close

Uses a standard 52 card deck.
Can be played with 2 or more players

How to play:
the goal of the game is to get to the final showdown and have three of a kind or better in order to win.

1. Everyone is dealt 5 cards face down from left to right of the dealer.
2. The first betting round is now, in order to place a bet, you have to have a pair of jacks or better. There is no bluffing if you do not have a pair of jacks or better. You can call this bet, but you cannot raise it unless you also have jacks or better. Even if you have jacks or better you can opt to not bet this round as well if youd like.
3. Now starting from the left to the right you can trade in up too 3 cards for 3 new ones, or 4 if you have an ace.
4. Now is the second betting round. In this round you can bet no matter what you have. The tricky part is, in order to win the pot you either A. make everyone fold or B. have a three of a kind or better.
5. In the event more than one person makes the call and no one has a closer (three of a kind of better) you repeat the process. But anyone who folded is no long in the game and does not get dealt another hand.
6. The game goes until someone wins it all.
